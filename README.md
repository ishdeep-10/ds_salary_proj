# Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview
   1. Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.<br>
2 . Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium. <br>
3 . Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.<br>
4 . Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.<br>
5 . Built a client facing API using flask.<br>
